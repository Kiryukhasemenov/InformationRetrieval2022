# InformationRetrieval2022
This repository contains my projects related to the Information Retrieval course at UFAL, 2022. 

I had to implement two information retrieval algorithms:
1. Manually implemented vector space model IR algorithm - you can find it in [HW1](HW1) folder;
2. Implementation of the PyTerrier algorithm for the TREC dataset - lies in the [HW2](HW2) folder.

The data used for the algorithm is accessible [here](data).
